#CRUD RPG

If you defeat the boss you may create a new boss.
Monsters, maps, and characters are read from the server.(Maps and characters are randomly generated.)
If a monster or boss beats you it updates itself to become more powerful.
If any monster is defeated it is deleted.(Enemies have unique names but are based off of template creatures.)
