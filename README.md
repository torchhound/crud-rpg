# CRUD RPG

If you defeat the boss you may create a new boss.

Monsters, maps, and characters are read from the server(Maps and characters are randomly generated.).

If a monster or boss beats you it updates itself to become more powerful.

If any monster is defeated it is deleted.(Enemies have unique names but are based off of template creatures.)
